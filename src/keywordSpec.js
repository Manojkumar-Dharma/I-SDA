/**
 * keywordSpec.js
 *
 * Task I-121 - "One declarative rule spec per keyword". Rules for a given
 * keyword or record type currently live scattered across `*ConflictReason`
 * functions (dspfWriter.js), rule tables, and UI row/guard wiring
 * (webviewClientHelpers.js), each hand-synced against the DDS Reference
 * separately. This module is the first slice of a single declarative
 * source of truth those places can read from instead - started with the
 * USRDFN record type (I-121's own task note: "split by record type when
 * claiming"), the smallest and most self-contained rule surface.
 *
 * Each entry is verified against `DDS_Keyword_V7r6.txt` directly, not
 * against the existing code, per I-121's own instruction - the citation
 * in each entry's `ddsReference` field is the exact justifying text.
 *
 * Written as plain, dependency-free JS (UMD-ish), same shape as
 * dspfEngine.js, so it runs unchanged in Node (tests, this file's own
 * require chain) and in the webview (loaded as a plain <script> before
 * dspfWriter.js, which now takes it as a second factory argument).
